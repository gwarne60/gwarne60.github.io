### My Story
I began my career as a chemical engineer but quickly realized my passion lay in **automation** and **software engineering**. Over the years, I’ve built control systems, integrated cutting-edge technologies, and guided projects from ideation to completion—bridging operations with technological innovation.

When I’m off the clock, you’ll find me tinkering with hobby projects, contributing to open-source tools, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with code.

**Let’s build something amazing together!**
