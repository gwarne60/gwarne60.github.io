### My Story

I started my journey as a chemical engineer but quickly found my calling in automation and software engineering. Over the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in designing control systems, integrating cutting-edge technologies, and leading projects that bridge the gap between operations and technology. 

When I'm not working, I love tinkering with hobby projects, contributing to open-source tools, and exploring new ways to innovate with code.

Let's build something amazing together!
