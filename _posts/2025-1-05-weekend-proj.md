# Building the Factory of the Future: A Dockerized OT System with LLM Integration

So, I’ve been thinking a lot about how to expand my resume with new skills while still leveraging the knowledge I’ve built over the years in operational technology (OT) and industrial automation. I wanted to take on a standalone project that wouldn’t just simulate an industrial process but could also make decisions and operate autonomously. Ultimately, the dream is to design a system that uses **LLMs** to monitor, deploy, and manage process nodes—nodes that could generate not just data but real goods and assets.

This post outlines how I started with that ambitious goal and ended up creating a Dockerized system that integrates a simulation engine, an OPC UA server, and an LLM for natural language commands. While the project is still a prototype, it feels like a step toward building the factory of the future.

## Inspiration for the Project

Last week, I spent hours fleshing out a simulation of the SLC500 backplane—only to realize that full backplane emulation still requires a license that costs several thousand dollars. That frustration gave me the perfect excuse to dive into something new: **emulating OPC servers locally** and tying them into a modern tech stack.  

This sparked an idea. Instead of just building another OT simulation, why not design something modular and scalable? Something I could run locally or in the cloud, deploy with Docker, and use to explore the future of factory automation. And with LLMs becoming increasingly accessible, I wanted to integrate AI to simplify operator interactions and decision-making.

## The Vision: Factory of the Future

The core concept was straightforward:  
1. **Build modular OT nodes** (e.g., tanks, pumps, reactors) that can operate autonomously or as part of a larger process.  
2. Use **LLMs to manage and monitor** these nodes, allowing for intuitive interactions like natural language commands.  
3. Make it **portable and scalable** by containerizing everything with Docker.  
4. Design it to operate independently, requiring minimal human oversight while remaining responsive to high-level inputs.

This setup could one day mint and deploy new nodes, adjust parameters in real-time, and even optimize production schedules—all while providing visibility into the process.

## Building Blocks

### 1. **Tank Simulation Engine**
The first step was creating a simulation that mimics a basic fill-and-drain process.  
- The tank has an inlet valve for filling and an outlet valve with a pump for draining.  
- High and low-level switches dictate when to open or close the valves.  
- The state machine logic ensures the tank behaves predictably and safely.  

I used an OPC UA server to expose this simulation to external clients, making it accessible in real-time.

### 2. **Natural Language Commands with OpenAI**
Here’s where it got fun. I integrated the simulation with OpenAI’s API to enable natural language control.  
- Users can type commands like “Start the simulation” or “Stop the pump,” and the system interprets them via the LLM.  
- The LLM determines intent (e.g., starting/stopping) and responds with a clear directive.  
- This directive is then validated and used to control the simulation.  

It’s a simple interaction, but it opens up endless possibilities. Imagine operators managing an entire process line just by describing what they want to happen.

### 3. **Dockerized Architecture**
The next step was containerizing the project. I wanted each component to run independently but communicate seamlessly. Here’s how it’s set up:  
- **Back-End**: Runs the simulation engine, OPC UA server, and API for LLM interactions.  
- **Front-End**: A Node.js-based web interface for sending commands and viewing status.  
- **Optional Databases**: PostgreSQL for metadata and InfluxDB for process data storage.  

Using Docker Compose, I can spin up the entire stack with a single command. It’s modular, scalable, and ready for future expansion.

## Overcoming Challenges

### **Making LLMs Work for Automation**
One of the first challenges was getting the LLM to interpret commands consistently. For example, a vague input like “Should I start the simulation?” needed to be processed correctly.  
- I solved this by using system prompts to instruct the LLM to respond only with actionable directives, like “start” or “stop.”  

### **Scaling for Modularity**
Another challenge was designing the system to accommodate new nodes or processes without rewriting everything.  
- By separating the simulation, API, and front-end into distinct containers, I ensured that each part could be swapped out or updated independently.

## Results and Reflections

After putting it all together, the system now feels like a solid prototype for a factory of the future. Here’s what it can do:  
- Simulate an industrial process with real-time OPC UA data.  
- Respond to natural language commands, making it intuitive to control.  
- Run entirely in Docker, making it portable and easy to deploy.

## Looking Ahead

While this project is just a starting point, it opens the door to some exciting possibilities:  
1. **Dynamic Node Deployment**: Use LLMs to mint and deploy new nodes, expanding the system automatically.  
2. **Real-Time Optimization**: Integrate advanced analytics to adjust parameters on the fly.  
3. **Edge and Cloud Scalability**: Run the system on local edge devices or scale it across cloud environments.  

The ultimate goal? A self-monitoring, self-deploying OT system that bridges the gap between industrial automation and AI-driven intelligence.
