# Over the past 12 days of OpenAI Christmas and Google releases...

...there have been a couple huge models released lately that make end-user ease of higher level concepts 
easier than they were even last week. A good opportunity to test this was using a few other projects I've been wanting to pull together. Here's the high level as summarized by Gemini 2.0 Flash:

<div style="font-size: smaller;">
## Gemini 2.0 Flash w/ Thought:

The system allows users to define bread recipes and schedule production batches. As batches run, the PLC integration component simulates reading real-time data (like mixer speed and oven temperature) from the PLC and sends this data to the backend. The frontend allows users to monitor the production process and view information about recipes and batches.


Prerequisites:

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

    Python 3.8 or higher: The backend, PLC emulator, and PLC integration are written in Python.

    Node.js and npm (or yarn): The frontend is built with React.

    Docker: Required for running the frontend application.

    Oracle Database: An Oracle database instance is needed for the backend to store data. You'll need the connection details (host, SID, user, password). If you don't have a dedicated instance, you can use Oracle XE in a Docker container for testing purposes.

    A suitable terminal or command prompt: For executing commands.

    (Optional, for real PLC integration): A configured Rockwell Automation PLC and knowledge of its IP address and tag names. This project currently uses an emulator, so a real PLC is not strictly required for basic functionality.
</div>

So long story short I had a front end packaged in docker, a backend running locally on the host (this is to simplify
the plc simulated Ethernet commmunications) and a two way DBE for historical and runtime data. 
this is an architecture I've been building as a side project, and overall AI has been helpful
in building a state driven and s88 style architecture. But with a bit more processing power now I'm 
interested in building a reference for actual ladder logic. 

This is something I've had issues with in the past. With non-standard edge configuration for real world constraints 
(think edge node configuration) and managing maintenance of a database for low level abstractions in PLC code. After writing a simple SLC500 program for free from Rockwell, here's what Gemini 2.0 Flash w/ Thought returned:

Rung-by-Rung Analysis:

Rung 0: SOR BST XIC I:0.0/0 NXB XIC O:0.0/0 BND LEQ F8:0 3.0 XIC I:0.0/1 OTE O:0.0/0 EOR

    Syntax: SOR (Start of Rung), BST (Branch Start), XIC (Examine If Closed), NXB (Next Branch), BND (Branch End), LEQ (Less Than or Equal To), OTE (Output Energize), EOR (End of Rung).

    Logic: This rung controls the pump run output (O:0/0). It has two parallel branches (OR condition) and a series condition (AND).

        Branch 1: XIC I:0.0/0 - If the pump start pb (NO) is pressed (contacts closed).

        Branch 2: XIC O:0.0/0 - If the pump run output is already energized (latching logic).

        Series Condition: LEQ F8:0 3.0 - AND the T100 Pressure (F8:0) is less than or equal to 3.0.

        Series Condition: XIC I:0.0/1 - AND the pump stop pb (NC) is NOT pressed (contacts closed).

    State Impact: If the conditions are met, the pump run output (O:0/0) will be energized.

    Observation: This rung implements a start/stop circuit with a pressure interlock. The pump can be started by pressing the start button OR if it's already running (latching). It will only run if the pressure is at or below 3.0 and the stop button is not pressed.

Rung 1: SOR BST XIC I:0.0/4 NXB XIC I:0.0/5 NXB XIC I:0.0/6 BND XIC I:0.0/2 XIC I:0.0/3 BST OTL O:0.0/1 NXB MOV N7:1 T4:0.PRE BND EOR

    Syntax: OTL (Output Latch), MOV (Move).

    Logic: This rung controls the heater on output (O:0/1) and sets the preset value of the Heater RunTime At SP timer (T4:0).

        Parallel Branches (OR):

            XIC I:0.0/4 - Heater local pb 1 (start) is pressed.

            XIC I:0.0/5 - heater pb 2 start is pressed.

            XIC I:0.0/6 - heater remote start is active.

        Series Conditions (AND):

            XIC I:0.0/2 - Heater local stop 1 is NOT pressed.

            XIC I:0.0/3 - Heater local stop 2 is NOT pressed.

        Output Latch: OTL O:0.0/1 - If the conditions are met, the heater on output (O:0/1) is latched ON. It will stay ON until unlatched.

        Move Instruction: MOV N7:1 T4:0.PRE - The value from Heater Runtime SP (remote) (N7:1) is moved to the preset value (T4:0.PRE) of the Heater RunTime At SP timer.

    State Impact: If any of the start pushbuttons are pressed AND both local stop buttons are NOT pressed, the heater on output will be energized and latched. The timer T4:0 will have its preset value updated.

    Observation: This rung implements the start/stop logic for the heater with local and remote start options, and two local stop buttons for redundancy. It also sets the runtime preset for the next rung's timer.

Rung 2: SOR XIC O:0.0/1 BST GRT F8:1 F8:2 NXB XIC T4:0/EN BND TON T4:0 1.0 30 0 EOR

    Syntax: GRT (Greater Than), TON (Timer On-Delay).

    Logic: This rung controls the Heater RunTime At SP timer (T4:0).

        XIC O:0.0/1 - The heater on output is energized.

        Parallel Branches (OR):

            GRT F8:1 F8:2 - The Heater PV (F) is greater than the Heater SP (F) (meaning the heater has reached or exceeded the setpoint).

            XIC T4:0/EN - The Heater RunTime At SP timer is already enabled (this allows the timer to continue running if the temperature fluctuates below the setpoint momentarily).

        TON T4:0 1.0 30 0 - If the conditions are met, the Timer On-Delay instruction for T4:0 is activated with:

            Preset: 30 (likely seconds, given the 1.0 Time Base).

            Accumulator: 0 (starts at 0).

    State Impact: The Heater RunTime At SP timer (T4:0) will start accumulating time when the heater is on AND either the process value is above the setpoint OR the timer is already running. The timer's Enable bit (T4:0/EN) will be set when the rung becomes true. The Done bit (T4:0/DN) will be set when the accumulator reaches the preset value.

    Observation: This rung starts a timer once the heater is on and the temperature has reached or exceeded the setpoint. The timer is likely used to track how long the heater stays at the setpoint.

Rung 3: SOR BST XIC T4:0/DN NXB XIO I:0.0/2 NXB XIO I:0.0/3 NXB GRT F8:1 250.0 BND OTU O:0.0/1 EOR

    Syntax: XIO (Examine If Open), OTU (Output Unlatch).

    Logic: This rung unlatches the heater on output (O:0/1), turning the heater OFF.

        Parallel Branches (OR):

            XIC T4:0/DN - The Heater at sp time timer (T4:0) has timed out (Done bit is set).

            XIO I:0.0/2 - Heater local stop 1 is pressed (contacts open).

            XIO I:0.0/3 - Heater local stop 2 is pressed (contacts open).

            GRT F8:1 250.0 - The Heater PV (F) is greater than 250.0 (likely a high-temperature safety limit).

        OTU O:0.0/1 - If any of these conditions are true, the heater on output (O:0/1) is unlatched, turning the heater OFF.

    State Impact: The heater on output will be turned OFF if the timer has reached its preset, or either local stop button is pressed, or if the temperature exceeds the high limit.

    Observation: This rung provides multiple ways to stop the heater: automatically after a set time at the setpoint, manually via local stop buttons, or via a high-temperature safety interlock.

Rung 4: SOR BST XIC I:0.0/7 NXB XIC O:0.0/2 BND XIC I:0.0/9 OTL O:0.0/2 EOR

    Logic: This rung controls the Agit run coil output (O:0/2).

        Parallel Branches (OR):

            XIC I:0.0/7 - Agit start pb is pressed.

            XIC O:0.0/2 - The Agit run coil output is already energized (latching logic).

        Series Condition (AND):

            XIC I:0.0/9 - Agit stop pb is NOT pressed.

        OTL O:0.0/2 - If the conditions are met, the Agit run coil output is latched ON.

    State Impact: The Agit run coil output will be energized and latched if the start button is pressed OR if it's already running, AND the stop button is not pressed.

    Observation: This is a standard start/stop latching circuit for the agitator.

Rung 5: SOR XIC O:0.0/2 BST MOV N7:3 O:0.1 NXB ONS B3:0/0 MOV N7:2 T4:1.PRE BND EOR

    Syntax: ONS (One-Shot Rising).

    Logic: This rung controls the agitator speed setting and sets the preset for the agitator runtime timer.

        XIC O:0.0/2 - The Agit run coil is energized.

        Branch 1: MOV N7:3 O:0.1 - Move the value from Agit % SP (remote) (N7:3) to the Agit Speed Pot (O:0.1). This likely controls the speed of the agitator via an analog output.

        Branch 2: ONS B3:0/0 MOV N7:2 T4:1.PRE - When the Agit run coil transitions from OFF to ON (rising edge detected by the ONS instruction on bit B3:0/0), the value from Agit Runtime SP (remote) (N7:2) is moved to the preset value (T4:1.PRE) of the Agitator Runtime SP timer. The B3:0/0 bit acts as a one-shot to only execute the move once per start.

    State Impact: When the agitator is started, its speed will be set according to the remote setpoint, and the Agitator Runtime SP timer's preset value will be updated.

    Observation: This rung sets the agitator speed and configures the runtime timer based on remote settings.

Rung 6: SOR XIC O:0.0/2 TON T4:1 1.0 90 29 EOR

    Logic: This rung starts the Agitator Runtime SP timer (T4:1).

        XIC O:0.0/2 - The Agit run coil is energized.

        TON T4:1 1.0 90 29 - If the agitator is running, the Timer On-Delay instruction for T4:1 is activated with:

            Preset: 90 (likely seconds).

            Accumulator: 29 (This suggests the timer might retain its accumulated value or be initialized with this value - check PLC documentation for specifics).

    State Impact: The Agitator Runtime SP timer (T4:1) will start accumulating time when the agitator is running.

    Observation: This timer tracks the runtime of the agitator.

Rung 7: SOR XIC O:0.0/2 XIO I:0.0/8 TON T4:2 1.0 10 0 EOR

    Logic: This rung starts another timer, potentially related to agitation.

        XIC O:0.0/2 - The Agit run coil is energized.

        XIO I:0.0/8 - The Agitator Running feedback is NOT active.

        TON T4:2 1.0 10 0 - If the agitator is running BUT there's no running feedback, the Timer On-Delay instruction for T4:2 is activated with:

            Preset: 10 (likely seconds).

            Accumulator: 0.

    State Impact: Timer T4:2 will start accumulating time if the agitator is commanded ON but the feedback signal indicating it's running is missing.

    Observation: This rung likely implements a fault detection mechanism. If the agitator is supposed to be running but the feedback is absent, this timer starts.

Rung 8: SOR BST XIC T4:2/DN NXB BST XIO I:0.0/9 NXB XIC T4:1/DN BND BND OTU O:0.0/2 EOR

    Logic: This rung unlatches the Agit run coil output, stopping the agitator.

        Outer Parallel Branches (OR):

            XIC T4:2/DN - The fault detection timer (T4:2) has timed out, indicating a problem with the agitator feedback.

            Inner Parallel Branches (OR):

                XIO I:0.0/9 - The Agit stop pb is pressed.

                XIC T4:1/DN - The Agitator Runtime SP timer (T4:1) has timed out, indicating the programmed runtime has been reached.

        OTU O:0.0/2 - If any of these conditions are true, the Agit run coil output is unlatched, stopping the agitator.

    State Impact: The agitator will stop if the fault detection timer times out, the stop button is pressed, or the programmed runtime is reached.

    Observation: This rung provides multiple ways to stop the agitator: due to a fault, manually, or after the set runtime.

Rung 9: SOR END EOR

    Syntax: END - Marks the end of the program.

Executive Summary of Control Logic:

This ladder logic controls three main unit operations: Pumping, Heating, and Agitation.

    Pumping: The pump is started by pressing the start button and will continue to run as long as the stop button is not pressed and the pressure is within the allowed range (<= 3.0). It includes a latching mechanism to keep it running.

    Heating: The heater can be started via multiple local or remote start pushbuttons. It has two local stop buttons for safety. Once started, it heats until the temperature reaches the setpoint. A timer then starts to track how long the temperature stays at the setpoint. The heater will turn OFF automatically after this timer expires, if a stop button is pressed, or if a high-temperature limit is reached. The runtime of the heater is determined by a remote setpoint.

    Agitation: The agitator is started and stopped using dedicated start and stop pushbuttons with a latching mechanism. Its speed is controlled by a remote analog output setpoint. A timer tracks the programmed runtime of the agitator. Another timer acts as a fault detection mechanism, checking for the presence of a running feedback signal. The agitator will stop automatically after its programmed runtime, if the stop button is pressed, or if a fault is detected (no feedback).

That was pretty good, one of the biggest things that sticks out to me missing is its failure to mention the interlock/permissive for the heating control despite mentioning it for the 'Pumping' summary. But overall the summary of the logic is correct, I was curious to see if it glossed over the temperature interlock on the heater or not in memory though:

Operational Outline: Pumping System

How to Operate:

    Start the Pump:

        Action: Press the "Pump Start" button (corresponds to input I:0.0/0).

        Logic: The rung will become true if either the start button is pressed OR the pump is already running, AND the pressure is within limits, AND the stop button is not pressed.

        Result: The "Pump Run" output (O:0/0) will energize, starting the pump. The output is latched, so releasing the start button will not immediately stop the pump.

    Stop the Pump:

        Action: Press the "Pump Stop" button (corresponds to input I:0.0/1).

        Logic: The rung will become false because the normally closed contact I:0.0/1 will open.

        Result: The "Pump Run" output (O:0/0) will de-energize, stopping the pump.

Safety Interlocks/Permissives:

    Low Pressure Interlock: The pump will not start if the "T100 Pressure" (F8:0) is greater than 3.0. This prevents the pump from running under potentially damaging low-pressure conditions.

    Stop Button as Emergency Stop: The "Pump Stop" button (I:0.0/1) acts as a direct break in the pump control circuit. Pressing it will immediately stop the pump regardless of other conditions.

Existing Functionalities:

    Manual Start/Stop: The pump is primarily controlled through manual pushbuttons.

    Latching Start: Once started, the pump will continue to run even if the start button is released until the stop button is pressed or the low-pressure interlock is triggered.

    Pressure Monitoring: The system monitors the "T100 Pressure" (F8:0) to prevent operation under low-pressure conditions.

Operational Outline: Heating System

How to Operate:

    Start the Heater:

        Action: Activate one of the following start inputs:

            "Heater local pb 1 (start)" (I:0.0/4)

            "heater pb 2 start" (I:0.0/5)

            "heater remote start" (I:0.0/6)

        Permissives: Both local stop buttons ("Heater local stop 1" - I:0.0/2 and "Heater local stop 2" - I:0.0/3) must not be pressed.

        Logic: If any of the start inputs are active AND both local stop inputs are inactive, the rung will become true.

        Result: The "heater on" output (O:0/1) will energize and latch, turning the heater ON. Simultaneously, the "Heater Runtime SP (remote)" value from N7:1 will be loaded into the preset of the "Heater RunTime At SP" timer (T4:0).

    Automatic Operation after Start:

        Logic: Once the "heater on" output is energized, the system monitors the "Heater PV (F)" (F8:1) against the "Heater SP (F)" (F8:2).

        Timer Activation: When the "Heater PV (F)" becomes greater than the "Heater SP (F)", the "Heater RunTime At SP" timer (T4:0) will start counting. This timer has a preset value set by the "Heater Runtime SP (remote)" (N7:1).

    Stop the Heater: The heater can be stopped in several ways:

        Automatic Stop (Timed):

            Logic: When the "Heater RunTime At SP" timer (T4:0) reaches its preset value (indicated by the T4:0/DN bit becoming true).

            Result: The "heater on" output (O:0/1) will be unlatched, turning the heater OFF.

        Manual Stop (Local):

            Action: Press either the "Heater local stop 1" (I:0.0/2) OR the "Heater local stop 2" (I:0.0/3) button.

            Logic: The corresponding normally closed contact will open, making the rung false.

            Result: The "heater on" output (O:0/1) will be unlatched, turning the heater OFF.

        Safety Stop (High Temperature):

            Logic: If the "Heater PV (F)" (F8:1) exceeds 250.0.

            Result: The "heater on" output (O:0/1) will be unlatched, turning the heater OFF.

Safety Interlocks/Permissives:

    Dual Local Stop Buttons: The presence of two local stop buttons provides redundancy for emergency shutdown.

    High Temperature Limit: The system automatically shuts off the heater if the temperature exceeds 250.0, preventing potential overheating and damage.

    Local Stop Permissives: The heater cannot be started if either of the local stop buttons is pressed.

Existing Functionalities:

    Multiple Start Options: Allows for starting the heater from different locations (local or remote).

    Latching Start: The heater stays on once started until a stop condition is met.

    Temperature-Based Timer Control: The heater operation is linked to achieving the setpoint temperature and then running for a specified duration.

    Remote Runtime Setting: The duration the heater runs at the setpoint is determined by the remote value in N7:1.

Operational Outline: Agitation System

How to Operate:

    Start the Agitator:

        Action: Press the "Agit start pb" (I:0.0/7).

        Permissive: The "Agit stop pb" (I:0.0/9) must not be pressed.

        Logic: If the start button is pressed OR the agitator is already running AND the stop button is not pressed, the rung will become true.

        Result: The "Agit run coil" output (O:0/2) will energize and latch, starting the agitator.

        Speed Setting: Upon starting, the value from "Agit % SP (remote)" (N7:3) will be moved to the "Agit Speed Pot" output (O:0.1), setting the agitator speed.

        Runtime Timer Setting: The value from "Agit Runtime SP (remote)" (N7:2) will be loaded into the preset of the "Agitator Runtime SP" timer (T4:1).

    Automatic Operation after Start:

        Logic: Once the "Agit run coil" is energized, the "Agitator Runtime SP" timer (T4:1) will start counting.

    Stop the Agitator: The agitator can be stopped in several ways:

        Manual Stop:

            Action: Press the "Agit stop pb" (I:0.0/9).

            Logic: The normally closed contact will open, making the rung false.

            Result: The "Agit run coil" output (O:0/2) will be unlatched, stopping the agitator.

        Automatic Stop (Timed):

            Logic: When the "Agitator Runtime SP" timer (T4:1) reaches its preset value (indicated by the T4:1/DN bit becoming true).

            Result: The "Agit run coil" output (O:0/2) will be unlatched, stopping the agitator.

        Automatic Stop (Fault Detection):

            Logic: If the "Agit run coil" is energized BUT the "Agitator Running" feedback (I:0.0/8) is NOT active, the timer T4:2 will start counting. If this timer reaches its preset (10 seconds), it indicates a potential fault.

            Result: The "Agit run coil" output (O:0/2) will be unlatched, stopping the agitator.

Safety Interlocks/Permissives:

    Stop Button as Emergency Stop: The "Agit stop pb" (I:0.0/9) acts as a direct break in the agitator control circuit.

    Fault Detection: The system monitors for feedback indicating the agitator is running. If the feedback is missing for a certain period while the agitator is commanded ON, it will be stopped as a safety measure.

Existing Functionalities:

    Manual Start/Stop with Latching: The agitator is started and stopped using a dedicated pushbutton with a latching mechanism.

    Remote Speed Control: The agitator speed is controlled by an analog output (O:0.1) set by the remote value in N7:3.

    Remote Runtime Setting: The duration the agitator runs is determined by the remote value in N7:2.

    Agitator Running Feedback Monitoring: The system uses input I:0.0/8 to verify the agitator is actually running after being started. This allows for fault detection if the agitator fails to start or stalls.

Okay so it did notice and mention it. I guess a highly detailed database is better for it to cache in local context than a summarized one. I would rate this a solid 9/10 as far as descriptions go. Out of curiosity, how much could it be condensed? A quick count shows this at almost 1900 tokens for...9 or 10 rungs of ladder logic. True its three whole unit operations, but the reality is without having to capture any faults or complicated logic just historizing this kept it almost at capacity. The truth is, functionally though this wasn't a bad write-up.

    IF !PB LOC I:0.0/2 & !PB LOC I:0.0/3 => OUT O:0.0/1 (LATCH): "If local stop buttons I:0.0/2 AND I:0.0/3 are NOT pressed, energize output O:0.0/1 (latched)."

    SET TMR T4:0 PRE=N7:1: "Set timer T4:0's preset to the value in N7:1."

    AUTO_OP: WHEN TEMP F8:1 > F8:2 => START TMR T4:0: "During automatic operation, when temperature F8:1 is greater than F8:2, start timer T4:0."

    STOP:: Indicates ways to stop.

    AUTO (Timed): WHEN TMR T4:0 DONE => OUT !O:0.0/1: "Automatic stop when timer T4:0 is done, de-energize output O:0.0/1."

    MANUAL (LOC): PB LOC I:0.0/2 | I:0.0/3 => OUT !O:0.0/1: "Manual stop by pressing local pushbutton I:0.0/2 OR I:0.0/3, de-energize output O:0.0/1."

    SAFE (HI_TEMP): IF TEMP F8:1 > 250.0 => OUT !O:0.0/1: "Safety stop if temperature F8:1 is greater than 250.0, de-energize output O:0.0/1."

    SAFE: - LOC_STOP_REQD (Prevent START): IF PB LOC I:0.0/2 | I:0.0/3: "Safety interlock: local stop buttons must not be pressed to start."

    MULTI_START: Multiple start options.

    TEMP_BASED_TMR_CTRL: Timer control based on temperature.

    REM_RUNTIME_SET: Remote setting for runtime.

Agitation System:

      
UNIT: AGITATOR
  OP:
    1. START: PB I:0.0/7
       IF !PB I:0.0/9 => OUT O:0.0/2 (LATCH)

       SET TMR T4:1 PRE=N7:2
    2. AUTO_OP: WHEN OUT O:0.0/2 => START TMR T4:1
               WHEN OUT O:0.0/2 & !FB I:0.0/8 => START TMR T4:2
    3. STOP:
       - MANUAL: PB I:0.0/9 => OUT !O:0.0/2
       - AUTO (Timed): WHEN TMR T4:1 DONE => OUT !O:0.0/2
       - AUTO (Fault): WHEN TMR T4:2 DONE => OUT !O:0.0/2
  SAFE:
    - STOP_PB (Direct STOP): PB I:0.0/9
    - NO_FB_STOP (AUTO STOP): WHEN TMR T4:2 DONE
  FUNC: MANUAL_CTRL, LATCH_START, REM_SPEED_CTRL, REM_RUNTIME_SET, FB_MON_FAULT_DET

    

Use code with caution.

Explanation:

    SET OUT O:0.1 SRC=N7:3: "Set output O:0.1 (speed pot) with the value from N7:3."

    AUTO_OP: WHEN OUT O:0.0/2 => START TMR T4:1: "Automatic operation: when output O:0.0/2 is energized, start timer T4:1."

    WHEN OUT O:0.0/2 & !FB I:0.0/8 => START TMR T4:2: "When output O:0.0/2 is energized AND feedback I:0.0/8 is NOT active, start timer T4:2 (fault timer)."

    SAFE: - NO_FB_STOP (AUTO STOP): WHEN TMR T4:2 DONE: "Safety interlock: automatic stop when timer T4:2 (no feedback) is done."

    REM_SPEED_CTRL: Remote speed control.

    FB_MON_FAULT_DET: Feedback monitoring for fault detection.

Benefits of this Token-Based Approach:

    Significant Compression: Reduces verbosity while retaining key information.

    Structured Format: Easier to parse and understand compared to free-form text.

    Machine-Readable: Lends itself well to programmatic interpretation.

    Focus on Actions and Conditions: Clearly highlights how to operate and the governing logic.

Considerations:

    Token Key: You would need a key or legend defining each token for someone unfamiliar with the system.

    Complexity Trade-off: For very complex logic, some statements might become slightly convoluted, requiring careful construction.

    Maintainability: Consistency in token usage is crucial for maintainability.
