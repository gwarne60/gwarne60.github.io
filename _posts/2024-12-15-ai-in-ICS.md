# Where AI Intersects Industrial Control Systems

Last week, Copilot was introduced at my workplace, and it’s been a real eye-opener. I’ve seen firsthand how AI can both enhance and complicate our existing workflows. On one hand, having a high-level processing tool is fantastic. On the other hand, my co-workers and I are starting to uncover the platform’s limitations and shortcomings.

Working in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), consistency and reliability are what keep the lights on. Manufacturing equipment runs smoothly day in and day out because every component is performing consistently, validated, and maintained. Right now, this level of consistency is something the entire AI field struggles with. AI has made incredible strides in terms of the breadth of applications and specificity within those fields, but the consistency required in ICS still demands human involvement. Human-in-the-loop programming and system control aren't anything new.

One of the most intriguing aspects of helping my co-workers leverage Copilot is context association—something the AI and I are working on simultaneously. As an ICS engineer, I’m interested in taking generic data types like L5X or XML files, breaking them down, and feeding them into large language models (LLMs). By providing guidance, whether it’s rung notation for ladder logic controllers or keyword descriptions and functional specifications, I aim to make these associations automatically.
