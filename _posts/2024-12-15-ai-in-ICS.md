# Where AI Intersects Industrial Control Systems

Last week, Copilot was introduced at my workplace, and it’s been a real eye-opener. I’ve seen firsthand how AI can both enhance and complicate our existing workflows. On one hand, having a high-level processing tool is fantastic. On the other hand, my co-workers and I are starting to uncover the platform’s limitations and shortcomings.

Working in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), consistency and reliability are what keep the lights on. Manufacturing equipment runs smoothly day in and day out because every component is performing consistently, validated, and maintained. Right now, this level of consistency is something the entire AI field struggles with. AI has made incredible strides in terms of the breadth of applications and specificity within those fields, but the consistency required in ICS still demands human involvement. Human-in-the-loop programming and system control aren't anything new.

One of the most intriguing aspects of helping my co-workers leverage Copilot is context association—something the AI and I are working on simultaneously. As an ICS engineer, I’m interested in taking generic data types like L5X or XML files, breaking them down, and feeding them into large language models (LLMs). By providing guidance, whether it’s rung notation for ladder logic controllers or keyword descriptions and functional specifications, I aim to make these associations automatically.

## Choosing an Example PLC Project

To illustrate the concept of context association within industrial control systems, I decided to use the [OpenPLC Project](https://www.openplcproject.com/) as my example. OpenPLC is an open-source platform that supports IEC 61131-3 programming languages, making it an ideal choice for demonstrating how PLC files can be parsed and analyzed using AI.

### Why OpenPLC?

- **Open-Source:** Completely free to use and modify, ensuring no proprietary constraints.
- **Standards Compliance:** Supports Ladder Logic, Structured Text, and Function Block Diagram.
- **Hardware Compatibility:** Runs on various platforms, including Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
- **Example Projects:** Offers a range of sample projects like traffic light controllers and motor control systems.

### Getting Started with OpenPLC

1. **Installation:** Follow the [OpenPLC installation guide](https://www.openplcproject.com/getting-started) to set up the environment on your chosen hardware.
2. **Exploring Examples:** Check out the [OpenPLC Examples](https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_v3/tree/master/Examples) repository on GitHub. For this blog, I selected the **Traffic Light Controller** project due to its straightforward logic and clear I/O mappings.
3. **Customization:** These examples serve as a foundation to understand PLC logic structure and how to parse and analyze these files for AI-driven context association.

## Parsing PLC Files for AI Integration

Using Python and libraries like `xml.etree.ElementTree`, I began parsing the L5X files to extract relevant keywords such as `interlocks`, `I/O mappings`, and `tag descriptions`. Here’s a snippet of the parsing script:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse('TrafficLightController.L5X')
root = tree.getroot()

for program in root.findall('.//Program'):
    program_name = program.get('Name')
    print(f'Program: {program_name}')
    for rung in program.findall('.//Rung'):
        print(f'  Rung: {rung.get("Number")}')
        # Extract more details as needed
