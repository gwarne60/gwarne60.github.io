# Where AI Intersects Industrial Control Systems

Last week, Copilot was introduced at my workplace, and it’s been a real eye-opener. While I consider myself very experienced in using large language models (LLMs) being given access to use it in the workplace has been unique as I can now see firsthand how AI can both enhance and complicate existing workflows. On one hand, having a high-level processing tool is fantastic. On the other hand, my co-workers and I are starting to uncover the platform’s limitations and shortcomings.

Working in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), consistency and reliability are what keep the lights on. Manufacturing equipment runs smoothly day in and day out because every component is performing consistently, validated, and maintained. Right now it appears this level of consistency is something the entire AI field struggles with. AI has made incredible strides in terms of the breadth of applications and specificity within those fields, but the consistency required in ICS still demands human involvement. Human-in-the-loop programming and system control aren't anything new, and this is leading me to believe the "10x" aspect of leveraging these tools vs complete replacement is the trend for high criticality systems.

One of the most stimulating aspects of helping my co-workers leverage Copilot is context association—something I enjoy working to standardize and reflect on. As an ICS engineer, I’m interested in taking generic data types like L5X or XML files, breaking them down, and feeding them into LLMs. By providing guidance, whether it’s rung notation for ladder logic controllers or keyword descriptions and functional specifications, I aim to make these associations automatically. Building a framework for an LLM to understand code that controls real assets is in some ways more and less difficult than I might have imagined. It sort of feels like if I feed a proverb into Google translate, and translate it back and forth to check how effective it is at maintaining the context and meaning.

Now I am obviously not at the cutting edge in this field, and I'm not complaining with how great a lot of these projects and applications online are. If I threw a dart blindfolded I could on any given week hit a trending repository for python on Githubs frontpage that is an open source architecture to accomplish something like this. I really think the enterprise solutions like GCS/MA/AWS will just take market share, but this doesn't stop specialized platforms from having use cases. 

One that I appreciated was "Openhands" (https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands) due to the ease of spinup and dependencies. This was short-lived, as in the past week the updates to Googles NotebookLM (https://notebooklm.google.com/) seem to have usurped even that environment. But having multiple tools and platforms to call is definitely not going to hurt moving forward for any type of application developments as agentic systems get fleshed out in end to end workflows.
